# PR.3---Collection-Manipulator
---
Objective:-

The objective of this project is to create a Python program called Student Data Organizer that manages a collection of student records. The program applies intermediate-level Python concepts such as string formatting and manipulation, collection data types (List, Tuple, Set, and Dictionary), mutability and immutability, type casting, the del keyword, and the match-case control structure.

Problem Description:-

Managing student data manually can be inefficient and error-prone. This program provides a menu-driven solution that allows users to add, view, update, and delete student records, as well as display all unique subjects offered by students. The program runs continuously until the user chooses to exit.

Data Structures Used

1. List:-

Used to store multiple student records.

Demonstrates mutability by adding, updating, and deleting student data.


2. Tuple:-

Used to store immutable student information such as Student ID and Date of Birth.

Once created, this data cannot be modified.


3. Dictionary:-

Used to organize student records efficiently.

Student ID is used as the key, and student details are stored as values.


4. Set:-
